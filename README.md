# To Do List

This is a React project built for the William Hill code challenge.

## Set up

1. Fork Repo
2. In  terminal: Navigate into the `WHCC`
3. Run `yarn install && yarn start`
4. This should open (http://localhost:3000/) 

## Things I would do with more time

1. Figure out RSS Feeds (I kept getting a 403 Error trying to fetch the data, but I can go to the actual URL and see the XML)
2. I would remove any hard coding so this could be viable for any team
3. I would connect to live APIs for the Wager's section and Whose Hot
4.  Media Queiries for mobile styling

## My thinking through this projcet
As a sports team you want to do a few things:
1. Let your fans show you care about them. I did this by highlighting the fan art, if fans take the time to make stuff about the team we should celebrate that and encourage more of it.
2. Understand where the sports industry going and highlight sports gambling. This is a delicate balance because you need to consider kids and non-gambling fans who may not be interested.
3. Make it fun! I tried to accomplish this with the Whose Hot section. It could be relevant and timely information but it also gives people a reason to check the site and see who is doing well if you haven't been watching every pitch.
4. Give the people what they want. Most people are coming to a sports teams website in order to find out what's going on, the news is a MUST.
